If you discover a security vulnerability, please **DO NOT** create a public issue. Instead:

**📧 Email**: security@vortex-mods.com
**🔒 Subject**: [SECURITY] Brief description of the issue

### What to Include
Please provide as much information as possible:

- **Type of vulnerability** (RCE, privilege escalation, etc.)
- **Affected components** (installer, configuration, etc.)
- **Steps to reproduce** the vulnerability
- **Potential impact** and attack scenarios
- **Suggested fix** (if you have one)

### Response Timeline
- **24 hours**: Initial acknowledgment
- **72 hours**: Preliminary assessment
- **7 days**: Detailed analysis and fix timeline
- **30 days**: Maximum time to public disclosure

## 🔍 Security Considerations

### Installation Security
- ✅ **Administrator verification**: Requires explicit admin consent
- ✅ **Digital signatures**: All binaries are code-signed
- ✅ **Checksum validation**: Files integrity verification
- ✅ **Sandbox testing**: Isolated test environment available

### Runtime Security
- ✅ **No network access**: Completely offline operation
- ✅ **File system isolation**: Limited to specified directories
- ✅ **Registry protection**: Minimal registry modifications
- ✅ **Process isolation**: Runs with minimal privileges

### Data Protection
- ✅ **No telemetry**: Zero data collection
- ✅ **Local storage only**: All data stays on user's machine
- ✅ **Encrypted configs**: Sensitive settings are encrypted
- ✅ **Secure deletion**: Temporary files are securely removed

## 🛠️ Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **Download only from official sources**
   - GitHub releases page
   - Official project website
   - Verified mirrors only

2. **Verify file integrity**
   ```bash
   # Check SHA256 hash
   certutil -hashfile VortexSetup.exe SHA256
   ```

3. **Run with minimal privileges**
   - Use dedicated user account if possible
   - Avoid running as full administrator
   - Use Windows UAC when prompted

4. **Keep software updated**
   - Install security updates promptly
   - Monitor security announcements
   - Subscribe to security notifications

### For Developers
1. **Secure development practices**
   - Code review for all changes
   - Static analysis tools
   - Dependency vulnerability scanning
   - Regular security audits

2. **Input validation**
   - Validate all file paths
   - Sanitize configuration inputs
   - Check file permissions
   - Verify digital signatures

## 🔒 Security Features

### Code Signing
All executables are signed with:
- **Extended Validation (EV) certificate**
- **Timestamp validation**
- **Certificate chain verification**

### File Integrity
- **SHA256 checksums** for all files
- **Digital signature verification**
- **Tamper detection mechanisms**

### Sandboxing
- **Limited file system access**
- **No network connectivity required**
- **Registry access restrictions**
- **Process privilege limitations**

## 🚫 Known Limitations

### Windows Defender
Some antivirus software may flag the installer due to:
- **Packing/compression** techniques used
- **Registry modifications** during installation
- **System file operations** required for setup

**Mitigation**: All files are submitted to major antivirus vendors for whitelisting.

### User Account Control (UAC)
Administrator privileges are required for:
- **System directory access** (Program Files)
- **Registry modifications** (HKLM keys)
- **Service installation** (optional components)
